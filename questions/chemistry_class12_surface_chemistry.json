Here we have 100 mL gold sol and 1 mL NaCl? No, usually it's scaled. If 1 mL NaCl coagulates 10 mL, then for 100 mL we might need 10 mL NaCl. The question says 'before adding 1 mL of 10% NaCl'. This implies 1 mL NaCl is enough to coagulate 100 mL? Unlikely. Standard definition uses 10 mL sol. Let's assume the question implies the standard condition is being tested on a larger volume or the ratio is maintained. If 1 mL NaCl is added to 100 mL, it's less conc than 1 mL to 10 mL. Let's re-read carefully. 'coagulation of 100 mL... prevented by 0.25 g... before adding 1 mL of 10% NaCl'. If 1 mL NaCl is the trigger, and it works on 100 mL, then the protection is for this specific condition. But Gold Number is defined for 10 mL sol + 1 mL NaCl. If we have 100 mL sol, and we add 1 mL NaCl, the salt concentration is 1/10th of standard. This makes it easier to protect? Or maybe the question assumes 1 mL NaCl is the standard dose per 10 mL? If so, for 100 mL we would need 10 mL NaCl. If only 1 mL is added, it's ambiguous. Let's assume the question meant 'standard gold sol' conditions but scaled. Or maybe it's a trick. Let's calculate mg of X. 0.25 g = 250 mg. If this protects 100 mL, then for 10 mL we need 25 mg. So Gold Number = 25. Let's check option 25. Yes. If the question implies 1 mL NaCl is sufficient to coagulate 100 mL (unlikely), then 250 mg protects 100 mL. But standard is 10 mL. Let's go with 25.",
