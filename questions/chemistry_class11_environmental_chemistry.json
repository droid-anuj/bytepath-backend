Safe. F limit is 1 ppm (1000 ppb). Sample has 1000 ppb. Safe. SO4 limit is 500 ppm. Sample has 100 ppm. Safe. Wait. Is NO3 > 50 ppm harmful? Yes. Is 50 ppm safe? Usually limit is 50 mg/L. Let's recheck. Maybe one of them is above limit. Pb limit is 0.05 ppm = 50 ppb. Sample 40 ppb. Safe. F limit 1.5 ppm? 1.0-1.5 ppm. Sample 1 ppm. Safe. Nitrate limit 50 ppm. Sample 50 ppm. Safe? Sulphate limit 500 ppm. Sample 100 ppm. Safe. Maybe the question implies one is high. Let's check standard NCERT values. F: 1 ppm. Pb: 50 ppb. SO4: 500 ppm. NO3: 50 ppm. All seem within or at limit. However, if any is 'unsuitable', maybe NO3 at 50 is considered high risk? Or maybe I am recalling limits wrong. Let's check. Pb limit is 50 ppb? No, it's 10 ppb (WHO) or 50 ppb (IS). Let's assume 50 ppb. Wait. Actually, if NO3 > 50 ppm, it causes blue baby syndrome. So 50 is the upper limit. Maybe the question implies which one is closest to being unsafe? Or maybe one IS unsafe. Let's look at Lead. 40 ppb. If limit is 10 ppb (EPA), then it's unsafe. If limit is 50 ppb (IS 10500), it's safe. NCERT says Lead limit is 50 ppb. Nitrate limit 50 ppm. Sulphate 500 ppm. Fluoride 1 ppm. All are at or below NCERT limits. Wait. Let me check the question source or similar PYQ. JEE Main 2016 question: F 1000 ppb, Pb 40 ppb, SO4 100 ppm, NO3 50 ppm. Answer is Nitrate? No, wait. 1000 ppb F = 1 ppm. Safe. 40 ppb Pb. Safe (limit 50). 100 ppm SO4. Safe (limit 500). 50 ppm NO3. Safe (limit 50). Is there a catch? Maybe the question says 'Which ... makes water unsuitable'. Maybe one is actually unsafe. Let's check if Nitrate limit is strictly < 50. Yes. So 50 might be considered borderline/unsafe? Actually, in that specific JEE question, the answer given was 'Nitrate' by some, 'None' by others. But wait. Let's check if I missed a unit. 1000 ppb F = 1 ppm. Correct. 40 ppb Pb. Correct. 100 ppm SO4. Correct. 50 ppm NO3. Correct. Let's assume the question implies one is the problem. Usually Nitrate at 50 is the concern. Let's pick Nitrate.",
