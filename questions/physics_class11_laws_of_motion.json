If track is like a hill, mg - N = mv^2/R => N = mg - mv^2/R. To maximize N, minimize mv^2/R. v is same (energy conservation). So maximize R? No. If N = mg - mv^2/R, then larger R means smaller term subtracted, so larger N. BUT if track is a loop (vertical circle), at top N + mg = mv^2/R => N = mv^2/R - mg. Then smaller R means larger N. Question implies 'shot into tracks', likely loops or hills. If hills, block might leave contact. If loops, N = mv^2/R - mg. Smallest R gives largest N. Let's assume loops.",
