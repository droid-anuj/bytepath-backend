Assuming only B field affects the turning back or if d is small enough. The radius of circle is mv/eB. To not reach B, d > r? No, usually the condition for not reaching is d > 2r. But here question asks 'will reach'. If d is small, they reach. The limiting condition is usually related to the Larmor radius. Let's assume standard result for crossed fields or just magnetic deflection. If B is strong, electrons turn back. Radius r = \u221a(2mK)/eB. If d > r, they might not reach? Actually, for reaching, d must be small. Let's re-evaluate. If only B exists, max distance is 2r. If d > 2r, they don't reach. So for reaching d < 2r. But options are like d > r. Let's check the specific problem context usually found in JEE. The condition for crossing is d < \u221a(2mK)/eB is incorrect. The max range is 2mv/eB. Wait, if V is present, it accelerates. This is a magnetron type problem. The condition for electrons to just graze plate B is 1/2 m v_max^2 = e V_cutoff? No. The standard result for 'not reaching' in crossed fields (Hull cut-off) is V < e B^2 d^2 / 2m. So for reaching V > e B^2 d^2 / 2m. d^2 < 2mV/eB^2. d < \u221a(2mV/eB^2). This doesn't match options. Let's assume V=0. Then max dist is 2r = 2\u221a(2mK)/eB. If d < 2r, they reach. Options don't have factor 2. Let's assume the question implies 'will NOT reach' or 'just fail to reach'. Or maybe the question is about magnetic deflection only. Let's go with the most plausible dimensional match and standard form. r = \u221a(2mK)/eB. If d > r, they might turn back before reaching if emitted at angle. But max range is 2r. Let's assume the question is from a specific source. Correct condition often cited is d > \u221a(2mK)/eB for NOT reaching? Let's assume option B is the intended answer for a specific setup.",
