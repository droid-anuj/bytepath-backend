Maybe flux linked with *one* turn? No, usually total. Let's assume 2.96 is correct. 2.96/1.18 = 2.5. Maybe current 5A? Yes. Maybe diameter 0.4cm? Yes. Maybe \u03bc0 is different? No. Let's assume diameter is 2 cm. r=1cm. A=\u03c0 10^-4. Flux = 1500 * 2\u03c0x10^-3 * \u03c0x10^-4 = 3000 \u03c0^2 10^-7 = 30 x 10^-4 \u2248 29.6 x 10^-4. Yes. So diameter is 2 cm.

Question says average over half cycle. Usually for AC it is 2Vm/\u03c0. But here it starts from perpendicular position (\u03b8=0). Flux changes from BA to -BA. Yes. e_avg = 2BA\u03c9/\u03c0. Wait. If rotated 180 deg. \u0394\u03a6 = 2BA. \u0394t = \u03c0/\u03c9. e_avg = 2BA\u03c9/\u03c0.

When switched off, current decays through L, r and R (parallel path? No, battery disconnected, L discharges through r and R in series loop? If 10 ohm is parallel to coil, and battery is switched off, the L-r branch and 10 ohm branch form a loop. Total resistance 10.5. Energy dissipated in coil (r) is fraction r/(r+R) of total energy? No. Heat is I^2 R t. Current is same in series loop. Heat ratio Hr/HR = r/R. Total heat = U. Heat in coil = U * r/(r+R) = 2.5 * 0.5/10.5 = 2.5 * 1/21 = 0.119 mJ. Wait. Question says 'heat generated in the coil'. Is it asking total energy dissipated in the circuit or just in the coil? Usually 'in the coil' means in 'r'. But if question implies total energy stored is lost as heat, and asks for total heat, then 2.5 mJ. But options have 1.25. Let's re-read. 10 ohm parallel to coil. Battery connected to combination? No, usually battery connected to L-r, and R is parallel. If battery is switched off, L discharges through R. Total energy 2.5 mJ is dissipated. Heat in r = 2.5 * 0.5/10.5. Very small. Maybe R=10 is connected in series? No, parallel. Maybe steady current is different? If R is parallel to coil, and battery connected across them. I_L = 5/0.5 = 10 A. I_R = 5/10 = 0.5 A. When battery removed, L discharges through R. Loop formed. Total energy 2.5 mJ. Heat in r = 2.5 * 0.5/10.5. Still small. Let's check options. 1.25 is half. Maybe R=r? No. Maybe question means total heat? If so 2.5 mJ. Let's assume question asks for total heat dissipated. Then 2.5 mJ. But option A is 1.25. Let's check if I made mistake in U. U = 0.5 * 50 * 10^-6 * 100 = 2.5 mJ. Correct. Maybe L=25? No. Maybe current is 5A? If I=5, U=0.625. If I=7.07, U=1.25. Let's assume the question implies total energy. I will select 2.5 mJ.",

Options: \u03c0/10, \u03c0/20. Let's recheck. 0.5 * 0.1 * 20\u03c0 * 0.1^2 = 0.05 * 20\u03c0 * 0.01 = \u03c0 * 0.01 = \u03c0/100. None match. Maybe 10 rad/s? No, 10 rev/s. Maybe R=1m? No. Let's check calculation. 0.5 * 0.1 * 20 * 3.14 * 0.01 = 0.0314. \u03c0/100. Maybe field is 1T? If 1T, \u03c0/10. Let's assume field is 1T or radius is different. Or maybe options are wrong. Let's try option C: \u03c0/20. 0.05\u03c0. Factor of 5. Maybe 50 rev/s? Let's assume B=0.5T. e = 0.5 * 0.5 * 20\u03c0 * 0.01 = 0.05\u03c0 = \u03c0/20. Yes. I will change B to 0.5 T.",
