Actually, the H-O-H angle in the water molecule itself remains ~104.5\u00b0. But the arrangement of O atoms is tetrahedral. The question asks H-O-H bond angle. It is still considered 104.5\u00b0 or slightly different but not 109.5\u00b0. Let me check. In ice, water molecules are H-bonded. The H-O-H angle is 104.5\u00b0. The O...O...O angle is 109.5\u00b0. Let's stick to 104.5\u00b0 as the molecular angle. But some sources say it opens up slightly. Let's assume the question refers to the molecular geometry which is bent.",
